Project Virtualso combines artifical intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and virtual reality to create customizable conversational humanoid agent capable of making emotion-driven facial expressions and body gestures.

## Inspiration
This project attempts to combine my knowledge in communication arts and VR to create realistic human interaction wthin VR. Due to COVID, many do not have access to in-person interactions and cannot develop the soft skills necessary, so I created several simulations such as job interviews and public speaking.

## Virtual Interview
The user interviewed by a conversational humanoid agent. The virtual interviewer can hold basic conversations and engage in realistic emotion-driven interactions such as facial expression, body gestures and much more thanks to Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Virtual Presentation
The user presents their slides in front of a room of AI audiences capable of reacting to the speech in VR. This project aims to help those with fears in public speaking and has been tested by formal employees from several companies and received very positive feedbacks.
