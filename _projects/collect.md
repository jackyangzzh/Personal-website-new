Collect is a social media startup I co-founded, aiming to enable people collect experiences through simple UI.

## Description
Collect is a platform that allows people to collect and store experiences in pictures. The saved images will be stored and sorted by collection type, making it easy for users to build unique collections, look back at their collections and share their photographs with users that have similar interests.
