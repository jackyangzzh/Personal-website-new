PolySpaceVR is a virtual reality social platform for customizability and small group gatherings.

## Description
Poly Space VR is a low poly, lightweight, open-source social platform where you can meet and chat with your friends in VR. You can create and share your own Poly Spaces by following the guidelines. Each month, an incredible version of Poly Space VR will be selected and uploaded to Oculus Store so everyone can join in on the fun!

## Inspiration
When I played VRChat, I noticed that the giant platform is great for meeting random people but not so much for intimate or customized experiences. After some research, I realized there is no VR social media platform targeted for small groups, so I created one myself. Due to the size of the project, I choose to make it open source and lightweight so that other developers who share the vision can contribute.
